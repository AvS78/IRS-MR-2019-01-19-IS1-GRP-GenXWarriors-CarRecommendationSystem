## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

We, Singapore citizens and residents, are known globally for our 5 C desires- car, condo, cash, credit card, and country club. Car ownership in Singapore for Singaporean Residents is a cherished aspiration. [Ref 1] captures the sentiment in international press. Closer home, Singaporean love affair for car ownership is evident from weekend newspaper advertisements.
However, Car ownership is a costly affair for us, primarily because of the need to control traffic, ranking Singapore as one of the costliest places to own and maintain a car. [Ref 2]
Our “love” affair with car ownership is so skewed that MAS (monetary authority of Singapore) has to step in to enforce financial prudence in Singaporeans. [Ref 3]
A wide range of choices of car brands offering a bewildering range of possibilities across ride, comfort, safety, gadgetry etc are available to Singaporeans. This is thanks to our open and services driven economy.
Above all aspects, makes the buying decision process a very confusing and suboptimal affair, leaving much room for improvement.
Our project, New car buy recommendation system, is an effort to improve the car buy decisioning system in Singapore. Our recommendation system today suggests car budget and car make/type to look for, thus narrowing down the choice process quite significantly.
We used a combination of expert interviews as well as carefully designed surveys to define a set of rules that help make optimal decision on car buying. To capture the fuzziness in buying decision, we reinforced thus defined/mined rules with the concept of certainty factor.
We used the KIE for user input capture, KIE DROOLS for decision rule, and additionally Orange pack as well as Excel, Tableau and Google sheet analytics for offline data exploration and data mining.
The solution we have presented is a first attempt to bring objectivity and optimality to car the decisioning process. Hence, we prepared a roadmap to capture further objectivity and augmented intelligence in car buying process.

Our achievement is happy Singapore car buyers, where they find the best ride suited to their needs and aspirations that the money they can realistically afford!
